August 31, 2013:
This is a simple configuration tool to quickly deploy changes to your Cisco switches and routers. 

What it does:
Allows you to copy in configuration changes, enter username and password, and pulls IP addresses from a host.txt file (that you
fill in).

How to use:
You will need Python 2.7 and the default libraries. Double click "cisco-deploy.py", input the IP or website you want
to test (www.sigwo.com).  

On Windows, a cmd.exe window will appear, running the code through it. The lines are a way of showing it is still running
and not hung.
